Project One - CS400 @ UW Madison
Group: AC
TEAM: blue

Things that went well for this team through project one:
--------------------------------------------------------
We had good communication with each other so that our work didn't face too much resistance. 
We also had a working hashtable java class, that makes a lot of work easier

Things that could be improved through future projects:
------------------------------------------------------
We could have started working earlier, so there's less pressure
We could find a better managing our code, instead of just doing pushing and 
got confused later on
